# BoostT1D - AI-Powered Diabetes Management Platform

## Congressional App Challenge Submission

**BoostT1D** is an AI-powered diabetes management platform designed to empower people with Type 1 Diabetes to take control of their health through intelligent insights, personalized recommendations, and seamless data integration.

## Problem Statement

Type 1 Diabetes affects over 1.6 million Americans. I’ve lived with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) for nearly 15 years, almost my entire life. I’ve spent years checking my glucose levels, counting carbs, adjusting insulin doses, and navigating all the unpredictability that comes with managing T1D. Over time, I realized that while we rely heavily on doctors and technology, most of diabetes management happens in real life, and often, we don’t have the right tools when we need them.

The idea for BoostT1D came from a simple dinner out with some of my T1D friends. We were all trying to figure out how many carbs were in our non-regular restaraunt meals, and it struck me how even after years of living with diabetes, we still didn’t have an easy way to get the information we needed. That moment stuck with me: if we could use AI to estimate carbs from a photo, we’d all make safer and quicker insulin decisions.

I also started thinking more about how we manage therapy.  We usually wait months to make changes to our doses with an endocrinologist. But those changes could actually be calculated based on patterns in our data, like basal rates, insulin sensitivity, or carb ratios. We don’t always need to wait for appointments when the math can be programmed. This was a big part of why I wanted to build an app that empowers people to take control of their doses safely and intelligently.


## Solution
